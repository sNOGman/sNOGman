# Hi, I’m Phill
A ROBLOX developer who has over 9 years of video game development management experience. 

I’m looking and willing to freelance for other developers and work with them to help achieve their own goals on their own projects.

You can reach me via my mail, pcreziles@gmail.com.
Looking forward to meet you!
